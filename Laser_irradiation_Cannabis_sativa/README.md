## Introduction

The trend in agriculture is to find alternatives that guarantee a significant increase in crop yields as well as a decrease in the use of pesticides, fertilisers and growth regulators, which means a high risk of environmental pollution [1][6],
fertilisers and growth regulators which means a high risk of environmental pollution [1][6]. Anthropogenic changes of the atmosphere, water and soil due to the use of different additives 
due to the use of different chemical additives to increase plant productivity lead us to look for alternative ways to meet the requirements of environmental preservation [2]. 
environmental preservation requirements [2].  Therefore, the controlled application of physical factors such as non-ionising radiation on the biological behaviour during plant development is of great ecological interest [4].
ecological interest [4]. In addition, the techniques applied to Cannabis sativa L. crops to improve their commercial and medicinal yields in industry are based on ionising radiation [3], without the use of ionising radiation [5].
ionising radiation [3], however these processes are costly, so applying solutions with other types of sources paves the way towards the generation of cutting-edge research in Ecuador.
Thus, the objectives of this research are focused on evaluating the effect of biostimulant treatments of non-ionising irradiation with He-Ne source on the emergence and development of Cannabis sativa L. crops.

> Application of irradiation treatments

For this preliminary investigation, a total of 60 seeds of the Cherry Oregon variety of Cannabis sativa L were used, to which 45 of them were applied nine treatments centred
on varying the exposure time (10, 15 and 20 minutes) and the applications of the treatment (1, 2 and 3 days) using a source of monochromatic wavelength photons (633 nm) 
from a He-Ne laser calibrated to a power between 29 - 32 ÂµmuW. Figure 2 summarises the amount of energy delivered to the seeds, ranging from 18 mJ (10 minutes), 27 mJ (1
5 minutes) and 39 mJ (20 minutes) for each application, with a maximum exposure in the last irradiation group of 60 minutes, equivalent to approximately 117 mJ.

- The seeds that received the treatments showed accelerated morphological development.
  
- When measuring the sizes of the seedlings at the third week (figure 4) with the ImageJ tool, we can highlight how the control seedling had a height of 4.799 cm, being in a stage of development 1004 according to the decimal code [5]; unlike its counterpart that received the treatment of 20 minutes in three applications, reaching a height of 9.748 cm and a stage of development 1006.
  
- In the fifth week (figure 5), the difference becomes more and more outstanding, because the control seedling reached a height of 11.741 cm and a growth stage of 1006. The irradiated seedling had a height of 23.254 cm and a growth stage of 1012, exceeding the control seedling by twice its size and twice the number of true leaves present.

## Discussion 

This research developed tests for the first time the impact of the application of laser irradiation treatments (He-Ne) to C. sativa species. To give more clarity to the results shown, a one-way ANOVA analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the different treatments compared to the control group. The results indicate that no statistically significant differences were found between the set of treatments and the control group (p = 0.0567). Since the p-value is greater than the conventional significance threshold of p < 0.05, morphological variation due to treatments cannot be related. However, when performing an ANOVA individually by treatment groups compared to the control group we found that treatment 7 (10 min exposure and 3 applications) is statistically significant with a p-value = 0.021, confirming that the effects observed in the measurements are a product of the laser irradiation treatment applied.

## Conclusions

The study evaluated the effect of laser irradiation treatments (He-Ne) on the growth of the Cherry Oregon variant of Cannabis sativa. Although the results showed accelerated morphological development in the irradiated plants, ANOVA statistical analysis only found significant differences in treatment 7 compared to the control group. This suggests that, under the conditions of this experiment, most treatments did not have a significant impact on plant growth, however the 10-minute laser stimulation in applications for 3 consecutive days caused a significant morphological acceleration in the seedling.
